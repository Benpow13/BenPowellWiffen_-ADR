ADR-02: External Database

Context and Problem Statement:

-Should the database be an external system to meet those requirments?
The CMS database must store user data, compliant information and customer information. The database needs to hold
sercure data have scaleability and compliance with GDPR regulations.

Decision Drivers:
-Ensures multi-tenency
-Sercuity and inline with GDPR regulations
-Relieablity and backup capablties

Considered options
-External Database(MySQL)  https://www.forloop.ai/blog/internal-and-external-data
https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-using-a-localhost-database-versus-a-cloud-hosted-database
-Embedded Database  https://raima.com/embedded-databases-an-in-depth-look/
-File-Based Storage  https://objectfirst.com/blog/file-storage-what-is-it/

Decision
-Chosen option- External Database
-Justifaction- This is the only option that ensures enough scaleability for 20 million users. It also allows for
a multi-tenecy apporach with each company having its only database and sercuity.

Consequences
Good:
-Resources (storage, processing power) are easily scalable on demand to meet growing needs
-The use of structured query languages enables useful querying capabilities, making it easier to handle large
amounts of data operations and analysis. 
-Multi-Tenant approach, using this type of database allows me to ensure data is not shared between compaines 
using this application as we can provide a database per tenant this allows incredibly high isolation. 

Bad:
-The challenge with external data is that it lies in its reliable integration and the maintenance of consistency
-Can have latenecy issues with larger datasets

Confirmation:
Intergation will be confirmed through:
-Sercuity testing
-Multi-tenecy testing

Pros and Cons of the other options

Embedded Database:
-Pro-Simple and easy to undertsand
-Con-No scaleable features
-Con-Unfit for the multi-tenecy approach

File-Based Storage
-Pro-Simple for end users to naviagate
-Con-Accessing and managing data issues occur when large amounts of data are involed.
