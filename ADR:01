ADR-01: Monolithic Architecture

Context and Problem Statement:

-What architectural style should be chosen to best meet the required solution for the CMS?
The CMS needs to be developed with the correct architecutural requirements to ensure the system meets all the delieverables and the NF
requirments. The system must support mulitpul roles and allow for future extension of the system.

Decision Drivers:
-Easy deployment of the system
-Lower infrasture and complexcity
-Ability to intergation future parts of the system
-Easy to debug and find an error

Considered options
-Monolithic architecture  https://www.atlassian.com/microservices/cloud-computing/advantages-of-microservices
-Layered architecture  https://zeeshan01.medium.com/the-weaknesses-and-strengths-of-layered-architecture-in-software-development-81ba1206a17b
-Microservices architecture  https://datamify.medium.com/monolithic-architecture-advantages-and-disadvantages-e71a603eec89

Decision
-Chosen architecture: Monolithic architecture 
-Justifaction: I have chosen to use this architecture because of its simplictiy and rapdid delivery. While still allowing for internal 
modularization for future intergation or different parts of the system. 

Consequences
Good:
-Faster development time
-Easier debugging and testing in the early stages
-Better performance- due to inter-component commutation

Bad:
-Harder to scale indivadual components
-Future changed may invole redlpoying the entire application
-The code may become tangled and messy, leading to be harder to understand for new employees

Confirmation
Complianace will be confirmed through:
-Architecture will be deployed in a single functioning unit
-Code struture meets the monolithic requirments 
-Components within the application are highly interconnected and interdependent

Pros and Cons of the options
Monolithic architecture
-Pro-Simplicity to deploy the system
-Pro-Better performance- due to inter-component commutation 
-Con-Limited flexablility when changing the system

Layered Architecture
-Pro-separation of the layers simplifies the development and maintenance,
-Con-Data must pass through multipul lays, can cause latency issues
-Con-Each layer can add increased complexitiy, therefore making it harder to understand

Microservices Architecture
-Pro-Advantages such as quick scalability, fault isolation and quicker deployment time
-Con-Increased complexity as you must develop serval services involving more code
-Con-Adopting microservices requires a shift in organizational structure
