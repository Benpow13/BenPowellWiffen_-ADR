ADR: 01 

Decision: Monolithic Architecture 

Alternatives considered:  

Microservices architecture- Has many advantages such as quick scalability, fault isolation and quicker deployment time. However, in comes with increased complexity as you must develop
serval services involving more code, debugging difficulties occur when you are handling multiple services each with its own set of logs.

Layered architecture- The separation of the layers simplifies the development and maintenance, for example changing the business logic typerically does not affect the presentation
layer. Isolated layers can be tested individually allowing unit and integration testing.

Justification-I have selected the monolithic architecture for a few reasons one of them being its simplicity to deploy, as the application is a single unit. Better performance- due to
inter-component commutation happens within a single process which can be fasted than network-based commutation. It's also very simple to debug because all the code is in one place and
can easily follow the flow of a request to find the issue. However, some negatives about the monolithic approach are that there is a high chance of having spaghetti code making it
harder for new users to the system to understand it, alongside this when you are making a small change to the system to deploy this you have to redeploy the whole system.
